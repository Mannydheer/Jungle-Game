### Jungle Game.

```
This is a game that I built in pure React as a challenge and for fun. A player can move around with arrow keys to collect bananas that are being guarded by a tiger. The player can damage the tigers by punching (spacebar). The point is the collect all the bananas as fast you can!

Features:
-Collision Detection.
-Shield
- Movement
- Player Sprite.
```

```
Improvements:
- Some of the tigers move out of the game box.
- Collision detection could be improved.
```

There are some other components that I did not complete. Possibly in the near future I can work on them.
